To generate the image, nine coarse General Circulation Models (GCM) are downscaled to a finer spatial resolution (0.44\u00b0x 0.44\u00b0) using the Rossby Centre regional model (RCA4) forcing its lateral boundaries. The model simulated daily temperature averages, which are used to generate projections of annual change. The projections are generated using the medium to low (RCP4.5) pathway which associates CO2 concentrations of approximately 560ppm by the year 2100.

To generate the image, nine coarse General Circulation Models (GCM) are downscaled to a finer spatial resolution (0.44\u00b0x 0.44\u00b0) using the Rossby Centre regional model (RCA4) forcing its lateral boundaries. The model simulated daily temperature averages, which are used to generate projections of annual change. The projections are generated using the medium to low (RCP4.5) pathway which associates CO2 concentrations of approximately 560ppm by the year 2100.

To generate the image, nine coarse General Circulation Models (GCM) are downscaled to a finer spatial resolution (0.44\u00b0x 0.44\u00b0) using the Rossby Centre regional model (RCA4) forcing its lateral boundaries. The model simulated daily temperature averages, which are used to generate projections of annual change. The projections are generated using the medium to low (RCP4.5) pathway which associates CO2 concentrations of approximately 560ppm by the year 2100. The associated RMSD it calculated and shows the uncertainty range of the projected model simulated residual values, and gives a relative perspective of spatial areas associated with higher and lower projection uncertainties.",

To generate the image, nine coarse General Circulation Models (GCM) are downscaled to a finer spatial resolution (0.44\u00b0x 0.44\u00b0) using the Rossby Centre regional model (RCA4) forcing its lateral boundaries. The model simulated daily temperature averages, which are used to generate projections of annual change. The projections are generated using the medium to low (RCP4.5) pathway which associates CO2 concentrations of approximately 560ppm by the year 2100.

The projections are generated using the medium to low (RCP4.5) pathway which associates CO2 concentrations of approximately 560ppm by the year 2100. The associated RMSD it calculated and shows the uncertainty range of the projected model simulated residual values, and gives a relative perspective of spatial areas associated with higher and lower projection uncertainties.",

To generate the image, nine coarse General Circulation Models (GCM) are downscaled to a finer spatial resolution (0.44\u00b0x 0.44\u00b0) using the Rossby Centre regional model (RCA4) forcing its lateral boundaries. The model simulated daily temperature averages, which are used to generate projections of annual change. The projections are generated using the medium to low (RCP4.5) pathway which associates CO2 concentrations of approximately 560ppm by the year 2100.

The projections are generated using the medium to low (RCP4.5) pathway which associates CO2 concentrations of approximately 560ppm by the year 2100. The associated RMSD it calculated and shows the uncertainty range of the projected model simulated residual values, and gives a relative perspective of spatial areas associated with higher and lower projection uncertainties.",

To generate the image, nine coarse General Circulation Models (GCM) are downscaled to a finer spatial resolution (0.44\u00b0x 0.44\u00b0) using the Rossby Centre regional model (RCA4) forcing its lateral boundaries. The model simulated daily temperature averages, which are used to generate projections of annual change. The projections are generated using the medium to low (RCP4.5) pathway which associates CO2 concentrations of approximately 560ppm by the year 2100. The associated RMSD it calculated and shows the uncertainty range of the projected model simulated residual values, and gives a relative perspective of spatial areas associated with higher and lower projection uncertainties.",

To generate the image, nine coarse General Circulation Models (GCM) are downscaled to a finer spatial resolution (0.44\u00b0x 0.44\u00b0) using the Rossby Centre regional model (RCA4) forcing its lateral boundaries. The model simulated daily rainfall averages, which are used to generate projections of seasonal change. The projections are generated using the medium to low (RCP4.5) pathway which associates CO2 concentrations of approximately 560ppm by the year 2100.

To generate the image, nine coarse General Circulation Models (GCM) are downscaled to a finer spatial resolution (0.44\u00b0x 0.44\u00b0) using the Rossby Centre regional model (RCA4) forcing its lateral boundaries. The model simulated daily rainfall averages, which are used to generate projections of seasonal change. The projections are generated using the medium to low (RCP4.5) pathway which associates CO2 concentrations of approximately 560ppm by the year 2100.

To generate the image, nine coarse General Circulation Models (GCM) are downscaled to a finer spatial resolution (0.44\u00b0x 0.44\u00b0) using the Rossby Centre regional model (RCA4) forcing its lateral boundaries. The model simulated daily rainfall averages, which are used to generate projections of seasonal change.

To generate the image, nine coarse General Circulation Models (GCM) are downscaled to a finer spatial resolution (0.44\u00b0x 0.44\u00b0) using the Rossby Centre regional model (RCA4) forcing its lateral boundaries. The model simulated daily rainfall averages, which are used to generate projections of seasonal change.

To generate the image, nine coarse General Circulation Models (GCM) are downscaled to a finer spatial resolution (0.44\u00b0x 0.44\u00b0) using the Rossby Centre regional model (RCA4) forcing its lateral boundaries. The model simulated daily rainfall averages, which are used to generate projections of seasonal change. The projections are generated using the medium to low (RCP4.5) pathway which associates CO2 concentrations of approximately 560ppm by the year 2100. The associated RMSD it calculated and shows the uncertainty range of the projected model simulated residual values, and gives a relative perspective of spatial areas associated with higher and lower projection uncertainties.",

To generate the image, nine coarse General Circulation Models (GCM) are downscaled to a finer spatial resolution (0.44\u00b0x 0.44\u00b0) using the Rossby Centre regional model (RCA4) forcing its lateral boundaries. The model simulated daily rainfall averages, which are used to generate projections of seasonal change. The projections are generated using the medium to low (RCP4.5) pathway which associates CO2 concentrations of approximately 560ppm by the year 2100. The associated RMSD it calculated and shows the uncertainty range of the projected model simulated residual values, and gives a relative perspective of spatial areas associated with higher and lower projection uncertainties.",

To generate the image, nine coarse General Circulation Models (GCM) are downscaled to a finer spatial resolution (0.44\u00b0x 0.44\u00b0) using the Rossby Centre regional model (RCA4) forcing its lateral boundaries. The model simulated daily rainfall averages, which are used to generate projections of seasonal change. The projections are generated using the medium to low (RCP4.5) pathway which associates CO2 concentrations of approximately 560ppm by the year 2100. The associated RMSD it calculated and shows the uncertainty range of the projected model simulated residual values, and gives a relative perspective of spatial areas associated with higher and lower projection uncertainties.",

To generate the image, nine coarse General Circulation Models (GCM) are downscaled to a finer spatial resolution (0.44\u00b0x 0.44\u00b0) using the Rossby Centre regional model (RCA4) forcing its lateral boundaries. The model simulated daily rainfall averages, which are used to generate projections of seasonal change. The projections are generated using the medium to low (RCP4.5) pathway which associates CO2 concentrations of approximately 560ppm by the year 2100.

To generate the image, nine coarse General Circulation Models (GCM) are downscaled to a finer spatial resolution (0.44\u00b0x 0.44\u00b0) using the Rossby Centre regional model (RCA4) forcing its lateral boundaries. The model simulated daily rainfall averages, which are used to generate projections of seasonal change. The projections are generated using the medium to low (RCP4.5) pathway which associates CO2 concentrations of approximately 560ppm by the year 2100. The associated RMSD it calculated and shows the uncertainty range of the projected model simulated residual values, and gives a relative perspective of spatial areas associated with higher and lower projection uncertainties.",

To generate the image, nine coarse General Circulation Models (GCM) are downscaled to a finer spatial resolution (0.44\u00b0x 0.44\u00b0) using the Rossby Centre regional model (RCA4) forcing its lateral boundaries. The model simulated daily rainfall averages, which are used to generate projections of seasonal change. The projections are generated using the high (RCP8.5) pathway which associates CO2 concentrations of approximately 950ppm by the year 2100. The associated RMSD it calculated and shows the uncertainty range of the projected model simulated residual values, and gives a relative perspective of spatial areas associated with higher and lower projection uncertainties."
